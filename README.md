# City Pulse – Local Events Explorer

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone the repo

To begin, you need to download the CityPulse project repository to your local machine.

Run the following command in your terminal to clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Nikunjp1904/CityPulse.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:
```sh
cd CityPulse
```

## Step 2: Install third party packages and required pods

This step installs all JavaScript dependencies and native modules required for the project.

Install the JavaScript dependencies using your preferred package manager.

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

For iOS development, install CocoaPods dependencies:
```sh
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Step 3: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Congratulations! :tada:
